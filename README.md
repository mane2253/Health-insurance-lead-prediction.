Introduction :

FinMan Company is looking to leverage their client base by cross selling insurance products to existing customers. Insurance policies are offered to prospective and existing clients based on website landing and consumer election to fill out additional information forms. FinMan company would like to leverage their acquired information to classify positive leads for outreach programs using machine learning classifiers.When these customers fill-up the form, their Response towards the policy is considered positive and they are classified as a lead. Once these leads are acquired, the sales advisors approach them to convert and thus the company can sell proposed health insurance to these leads in a more efficient manner.

Conclusion :

With each of the categorical values mapped to values with respect to average age, the resulting values will end up on a similar scale as the rest of the dataset. In order to minimize data manipulation for modeling, no label encoding or standard scaling will occur. Holding Policy Type three has the highest number of positive responses but all four of the categories have approximately 30% positive to negative client responses. Similar accuracy in the training and test sets suggests minimal under/over fitting.
